----------- MULTITHREADING -----------

1. INTRODUCTION

Multitasking:- Execution of multiple tasks simultaneously

Types of Multitasking
a. Process based:- Execution of multiple tasks simultaneously where each task is independent to others in different program.
   Example: Writing Java code, listening audion songs, downloading files from internet.
   
b. Thread based:- Execution of multiple tasks simultaneously where each task is independent to others in same program.
   Example: suppose we have one java program where 10k lines of code are there but half of it is independent to other so we can execute both
   task simultaneously.
   
Advantage of Multitasking:
    - to increase performance by reducing the response time of the system.
	
The main important Application areas of multithreading are:
    - to develop multimedia graphics
    - to develop animations
    - to develop video games
    - to develop web servers & Application Servers

When compared with old languages, developing multithreaded applications using Java is very easy beacause Java provides inbuilt support
for multithreading with rich API [Thread,Runnable,Thread Group...]

2. Ways to create THREAD
    a. extending Thread class
	b. implementing Runnable Interface
	
3. Getting & Setting name of Thread
   a. Getting name of Current Thread:- Thread.currentThread().getName()

4. Thread Priorities

5. Methods to prevent Thread Execution
     a. yield()
	 b. join()
	 c. sleep()
	 
6. Synchronization

7. Inter-Thread Communication
     a. wait()
	 b. notify()
	 c. notifyAll()
	 
8. DeadLock

9. Daemon Threads

10. Multithreading Enhancement
